# Imputing missing values

# 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

# 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
#    The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, 
#    you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

# 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

# 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and 
#    Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
#    Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
#    What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

# What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

# "The imputation of missing data has led to a notable change in the estimates of the total daily number of steps. After imputation, both the mean and median total daily steps increased to approximately 10,766.19, whereas, in the first part of the assignment, the mean and median were 9,354.23 and 10,395, respectively. This indicates that imputing missing data has a substantial impact on the estimates, resulting in higher values for the total daily steps."

# "Imputing missing data significantly increased the estimated total daily number of steps compared to the analysis with non-imputed data. This was done to address the presence of missing values and provide more complete and representative insights into daily step patterns. Imputation helps mitigate potential biases that missing data can introduce, leading to more accurate and comprehensive analyses of activity patterns."

# In conclusion: Imputing missing data in the total daily number of steps can:
# Improve data completeness.
# Alter mean and median values.
# Affect data variability.
# Potentially introduce bias.
# Impact hypothesis testing.
# Require careful interpretation.
# Imputation should consider data characteristics and potential biases.

# Codes tested: ALL OK!
